The project is about creating and building a pipeline using JENKINS.	

the process of the pipeline:
- clone the code from the github repo
- run quality tests using Sonarqube
- run unit tests
- build the jar and push it to Nexus repository
- build the docker image for the backend and database applications
- run both images using docker-compose to deploy it in the server

All the process of the pipeline was tested on local environment ( no remote servers were used )
